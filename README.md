# Foodle :ramen:

**Foodle** is where I save all the hidden street food gems I discover in Berlin.
It's a simple React app connected to an Express backend which persists data to a mongoDB atlas instance.

## Frontend :iphone:

- tba... :construction:

## Backend :floppy_disk:

- Typescript, Express, MongoDB
- Node 18 or newer is required
- Copy the content of `backend/.env.example` into `backend/.env` and insert your username and password for the mongoDB atlas instance
